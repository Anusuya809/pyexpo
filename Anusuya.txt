Irish poet, playwright, and genius of aestheticism have captured the true essence of the word ‘Memories’ in the quote mentioned above. Memories are beautiful flashbacks of a series of events that happened in the past that shape our identity, influence our behavior, and contribute to our overall well-being.

Early morning honking of the school bus while mommies ran with breakfast after kids and daddies dressed kids in school uniform while kids favorite Tom N Jerry cartoon played in the background was a sight to behold. Even in all sorts of confusion & chaos, everyone will agree that life was blissfully peaceful. 

In this article, let’s turn some unforgettable pages of ‘the school memory diary that we all miss in our adult life.
